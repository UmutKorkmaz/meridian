## 2025-03-03 - Avoid OpenTelemetry Async Wrapper Overhead
**Learning:** Returning `null` from `ActivitySource.StartActivity` (when no listeners exist) is not zero-cost if the subsequent dispatch is wrapped in an `async` state machine. The state machine overhead becomes a measurable bottleneck in hot-path abstractions like MediatR/Meridian dispatches.
**Action:** Always eagerly check `.HasListeners()` and completely bypass any `async` instrumentation wrappers, delegating directly to the underlying `Task`/`IAsyncEnumerable` returned by the handler.
